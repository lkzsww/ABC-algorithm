An Efficient Optimization Approach for Pressure Testing During Reentry Operation of Deepwater Drilling Riser System

Pressure testing should be conducted on auxiliary lines during riser reentry to ensure the seal security of connection positions. The proper setting of the number and positions of pressure testing is
essential because it can significantly reduce the high costs of offshore drilling.This study proposes an efficient optimization procedure for pressure testing during riser reentry.
A time-efficiency evaluation model and a risk assessment model are established based on the pressure testing process and entropy theory. The modified artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is used to optimize
the pressure testing process by incorporating the above proposed models.
